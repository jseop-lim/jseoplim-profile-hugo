## About Me

Hello! I’m a senior undergraduate student at the School of Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University. I’m currently preparing for graduate studies while exploring specific topics in programming languages and software engineering. My research interests include _Python_, _static program analysis_, and _machine learning–based software testing_.

Previously, I worked as a Python backend developer at a fintech startup, where I developed software to automate loan and investment processes. I care deeply about techniques, documentation, and practices that improve software maintainability.
